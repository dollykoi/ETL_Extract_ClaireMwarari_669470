# ETL_Extract_ClaireMwarari_669470
A lab exercise for DSA 2040A, USIU Africa.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates a basic ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline using Python and Jupyter Notebook. The main objective was to extract data from a source, apply necessary transformations, and load the processed data for further analysis or storage.

## What I Have Done

- **Set up the project environment** using Jupyter Notebook.
- **Created a `.gitignore` file** to exclude unnecessary files and folders such as:
  - Jupyter notebook checkpoints
  - Python cache folders
  - Log files
  - SQLite databases
  - Extraction logs
- **Initialized a Git repository** and connected it to GitHub for version control.
- **Documented and committed every step** of the ETL process for transparency and reproducibility.
- **Implemented the ETL workflow** in a Jupyter notebook, showcasing:
  - Data extraction from a given source
  - Data transformation and cleaning
  - Loading the prepared data for analysis
